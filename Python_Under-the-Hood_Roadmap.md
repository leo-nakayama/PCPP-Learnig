Perfect 👌 let’s lay out a **mini-roadmap** for “Python under-the-hood fundamentals.”
Think of it as a **side track** that complements certification prep but goes *deeper into the why*.
It’s structured so you keep getting those *aha!* moments without getting lost in overly academic corners.

---

# 🛠 Python Under-the-Hood Roadmap

---

## 1. Object Model Foundations

**Goal:** Understand how *everything in Python is an object* and how the runtime represents them.

* ✅ Explore `__class__`, `type()`, `isinstance()`, `issubclass()`.
* ✅ Compare `obj.__class__` vs `type(obj)`.
* ✅ Disassemble simple objects with `dir(obj)` and `vars(obj)` / `obj.__dict__`.
* 🧪 Exercise: Write a script that prints the `__class__` of an int, str, list, function, class, and method.

---

## 2. Lifecycle of Objects

**Goal:** Grasp the **construction vs initialization** model.

* ✅ Compare `__new__` vs `__init__`.
* ✅ Create a toy class that prints when each hook is called.
* ✅ Learn that `__del__` exists but is unreliable (garbage collector, refcounting).
* 🧪 Exercise: Implement a singleton by overriding `__new__`.

---

## 3. Functions, Methods, and Callables

**Goal:** See how “callable” is a general protocol.

* ✅ Learn difference between functions, bound methods, unbound methods.
* ✅ Use `callable(obj)`.
* ✅ Implement `__call__` in a class to make instances behave like functions.
* 🧪 Exercise: Write a class `Adder` where `Adder(5)(10)` returns 15.

---

## 4. Special Methods (“dunders”)

**Goal:** Demystify why operators work on objects.

* ✅ Study `__repr__`, `__str__`, `__len__`, `__iter__`, `__getitem__`.
* ✅ Compare `+` on ints vs strings → both rely on `__add__`.
* ✅ Realize you can make your own “duck typing” objects.
* 🧪 Exercise: Create a `Vector` class with `+` and `len()` support.

---

## 5. Modules, Namespaces, Imports

**Goal:** Understand how Python organizes code.

* ✅ Distinguish `__name__` (attribute) vs `"__main__"` (string literal).
* ✅ Learn about `__file__` and `__package__`.
* ✅ See how `__pycache__` stores `.pyc` files.
* 🧪 Exercise: Make a two-file project and observe how `__name__` changes when run vs imported.

---

## 6. Introspection & Metaprogramming

**Goal:** See Python’s runtime self-awareness.

* ✅ Explore `getattr`, `setattr`, `hasattr`, `dir`.
* ✅ Learn about `__dict__` and attribute resolution.
* ✅ Try writing a tiny metaclass that logs class creation.
* 🧪 Exercise: Create a metaclass that auto-adds a `greet()` method to every class.

---

## 7. Execution Pipeline

**Goal:** Connect *source → AST → bytecode → execution*.

* ✅ Use `ast.parse` to inspect literals.
* ✅ Use `compile()` + `dis.dis()` to see bytecode.
* ✅ Realize that function bodies are compiled but only executed when called.
* 🧪 Exercise: Disassemble a function that does list comprehension and see the LOAD/STORE ops.

---

## 8. Memory Model & Performance (lightweight)

**Goal:** Appreciate what Python does with objects under the hood.

* ✅ Learn about reference counting (`sys.getrefcount`).
* ✅ Understand mutability/immutability (why `id(x)` for small ints/strings doesn’t change).
* ✅ Observe how variables are *names bound to objects*, not boxes holding values.
* 🧪 Exercise: Prove with `a = b = [1]; b.append(2)` → both see the change.

---

# 📚 Suggested Path

* Work one theme at a time (1–2 weeks each).
* For each, do **tiny experiments** (like you’ve been doing with AST, dis, dunders).
* Write down in your own words: *Material, Formal, Efficient, Final cause* for each new discovery. This will cement the philosophy layer.

---

✅ **End goal:**
By following this roadmap, you’ll:

* Be way beyond “just cert-ready.”
* Have the same kind of mental model CPython core devs use.
* And still be able to *teach back* these ideas (on Note, LinkedIn, or even in an interview).

👉 Do you want me to draft a **1-page visual “cheat sheet”** that maps each stage (object, class, type, module, function, method, bytecode) with their key attributes (`__class__`, `__name__`, `__init__`, etc.)? That would give you a bird’s-eye view to pin on your wall.

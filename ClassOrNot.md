Perfect 👌 — here’s a **red flag checklist** you can keep handy to spot when you might be forcing a class where it doesn’t belong.

# 🚩 Red Flags: Forcing a Class in Python

1. **No real state**

   * Your class has no meaningful instance variables, just methods.
   * Often a sign it should be a `module` or just a group of functions.

2. **Single giant variable**

   * The class wraps just *one* data structure (dict, list, JSON, etc.) without adding invariants or richer behavior.
   * In that case, work with the data directly.

3. **No lifecycle**

   * There’s no real need for initialization, cleanup, or context management.
   * You’re just using the class as a namespace.

4. **Only one instance**

   * If you’ll ever create just a single instance in your program, the class is often just a glorified global variable.
   * Better handled with module-level variables or closures.

5. **All static methods**

   * If every method is `@staticmethod` or `@classmethod`, and no instance state is touched, you probably don’t need a class at all.

6. **Overuse of class variables**

   * You put shared mutable data in `Class.var` instead of per-instance attributes.
   * This often signals you’re misusing classes as “data bags” or hidden globals.

7. **No clear “is-a” or “has-a” reasoning**

   * You can’t answer why `X` is a subclass of `Y` without hand-waving.
   * That usually means inheritance is being used incorrectly.

8. **Final Cause missing**

   * You can’t clearly say *why* a class is better than a couple of functions.
   * If the purpose isn’t obvious, it’s probably not justified.

✅ **Quick mantra:**

> If the class doesn’t encapsulate state, lifecycle, or polymorphism → use functions, modules, or closures instead.

👉 Do you want me to condense the **green checklist (good reasons)** and the **red checklist (bad signs)** into a one-page “Class or Not?” decision flowchart you can stick next to your Python cheat sheets?

Perfect 👌 — here’s a **one-page decision flowchart** you can keep as a sticky-note style reference. It combines the *green checklist* (good reasons) and the *red checklist* (bad signs).

# 🐍 Class or Not? — Quick Flowchart

```
Step 1. Do I have meaningful state to encapsulate?
    └─ No → use functions or a module.
    └─ Yes → go to Step 2.

Step 2. Do I need behavior tied to that state
(methods that enforce invariants or rules)?
    └─ No → maybe just a data structure (dict, dataclass).
    └─ Yes → go to Step 3.

Step 3. Is there a lifecycle (init → use → save/close)?
    └─ Yes → class (maybe with context manager).
    └─ No → continue.

Step 4. Do I expect polymorphism or interchangeable backends?
    └─ Yes → class or abstract base class is justified.
    └─ No → continue.

Step 5. Can I clearly explain the final cause
("why a class is better than functions")?
    └─ No → you’re probably forcing a class.
    └─ Yes → class is justified.
```

# 🚩 Red Flags (Bad Signs)

* No instance variables, just methods → probably a module.
* Only one giant variable (dict, JSON, list) → just use the structure.
* Only one instance in the whole program → probably a global.
* All methods static/classmethod → just a namespace.
* Shared mutable class variables → hidden globals, avoid.
* Inheritance without a true “is-a” relation → misuse.

---

# ✅ Green Lights (Good Reasons)

* Encapsulate meaningful **state**.
* Provide **methods** that enforce invariants on that state.
* Manage a clear **lifecycle** (setup → use → teardown).
* Support **polymorphism** (common interface, different implementations).
* You can clearly articulate the **purpose** of the class vs functions.

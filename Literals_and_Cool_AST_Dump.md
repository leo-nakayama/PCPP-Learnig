User: What does it mean by "a string literal?" Does it mean "any form of string?" For example, 

var = "asdf"
var = "12"
var = 12.0

Is it like the variable var is assigned a string literal except for the last assignment (float not a string literal)?


Great question 👍 — “string literal” is one of those terms that sounds fancier than it is. Let’s break it down:

---

## 1. What “literal” means in programming

A **literal** is a value written *directly* in source code.
It’s the raw syntax that the compiler/interpreter turns into a real object in memory.

Examples in Python:

```python
42          # integer literal
3.14        # float literal
"hello"     # string literal
'world'     # string literal
[1, 2, 3]   # list literal
{"a": 1}    # dict literal
```

So a *literal* is not a variable — it’s the constant value itself as written in code.

---

## 2. What is a **string literal**

A **string literal** is simply text enclosed in quotes in the source code.
Python supports several forms:

```python
"asdf"             # string literal (double quotes)
'asdf'             # string literal (single quotes)
"""multi
line"""            # string literal (triple double quotes)
r"raw\nstring"     # raw string literal
f"hi {2+3}"        # f-string literal
b"bytes"           # bytes literal (not str, but similar)
```

All of these are *string literals*.

---

## 3. Your examples

```python
var = "asdf"   # "asdf" is a string literal
var = "12"     # "12" is a string literal (represents text, not a number)
var = 12.0     # 12.0 is a float literal
```

So in your examples:

* First two assignments → string literals.
* Last assignment → float literal.

---

## 4. Why `"__main__"` is a string literal

When we write:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    ...
```

* `__name__` → an **attribute** (variable) set by Python.
* `"__main__"` → a **string literal** (constant text written in code).

It’s just like writing:

```python
if x == "hello": ...
```

where `"hello"` is a string literal.

---

✅ **Summary:**

* A *literal* = a raw value written directly in code.
* A *string literal* = any text in quotes (`"..."` or `'...'`, including fancy forms).
* So yes: `"asdf"` and `"12"` are string literals; `12.0` is a float literal, not a string literal.

---

Would you like me to also show you **how Python parses these literals into objects** (e.g. using `ast.literal_eval` to turn text into actual Python objects)? That gives you a peek under the hood of what “literal” really means.

Perfect 👍 — let’s peek under the hood of how Python treats **literals** by using the `ast` (Abstract Syntax Tree) module.

---

## 1. `ast.literal_eval`

The function `ast.literal_eval` safely evaluates strings containing **Python literal expressions** (not arbitrary code). It turns text into actual Python objects.

```python
import ast

print(ast.literal_eval("42"))        # int 42
print(ast.literal_eval("3.14"))      # float 3.14
print(ast.literal_eval("'hello'"))   # str 'hello'
print(ast.literal_eval("[1, 2, 3]")) # list [1, 2, 3]
print(ast.literal_eval("{'a': 1}"))  # dict {'a': 1}
```

Output:

```
42
3.14
hello
[1, 2, 3]
{'a': 1}
```

Notice: `"42"` (a string of characters two and four) → **int 42** object after evaluation.

---

## 2. Why `literal_eval` is special

* It only works with **literals** (numbers, strings, lists, dicts, tuples, booleans, `None`).
* It does *not* execute code like `eval` does — so it’s safe.
* Example:

  ```python
  ast.literal_eval("__import__('os').system('rm -rf /')")  # ❌ raises ValueError
  ```

  (Where `eval()` would dangerously execute it!)

---

## 3. Literals vs variables in AST

Let’s inspect with `ast.parse`:

```python
import ast
code = "x = 'hello'"
tree = ast.parse(code, mode="exec")

print(ast.dump(tree, indent=4))
```

Output (abridged):

```
Module(
    body=[
        Assign(
            targets=[Name(id='x', ctx=Store())],
            value=Constant(value='hello')
        )
    ]
)
```

Here:

* `Name(id='x')` → the variable `x`.
* `Constant(value='hello')` → the string literal `'hello'`.

So Python explicitly distinguishes **variable names** and **literal constants** in its syntax tree.

---

## 4. Literal forms recap

* **Integer literal** → `42`, `0b1010`, `0o77`, `0xFF`
* **Float literal** → `3.14`, `1e6`
* **String literal** → `"hello"`, `'world'`, `"""multiline"""`, `r"raw"`, `f"text {expr}"`
* **Container literal** → `[1, 2]`, `(1, 2)`, `{1, 2}`, `{'a': 1}`
* **Boolean literal** → `True`, `False`
* **None literal** → `None`

All of these become Python objects **at compile time** — so by the time the bytecode runs, `"hello"` is already an object in memory.

---

✅ **Summary:**

* A *literal* is a constant value written in source code.
* `ast.literal_eval` shows how these text forms are parsed into objects.
* In the AST, literals show up as `Constant(value=...)`.

---

👉 Would you like me to build you a **side-by-side chart** showing: *literal in code* → *AST node* → *runtime object*? That would make the idea completely transparent.

Use: Cool stuff going on here! This is interesting.
---
import ast
code = "x = 'hello'"
tree = ast.parse(code, mode="exec")

print(ast.dump(tree, indent=4))

Yes! 🎉 That’s exactly the kind of experiment that shows what Python is really doing under the hood.

Let’s unpack what you’ll see when you run your snippet:

---

## 1. Your code

```python
import ast
code = "x = 'hello'"
tree = ast.parse(code, mode="exec")

print(ast.dump(tree, indent=4))
```

---

## 2. The output (Python 3.9+)

```text
Module(
    body=[
        Assign(
            targets=[
                Name(id='x', ctx=Store())
            ],
            value=Constant(value='hello')
        )
    ],
    type_ignores=[]
)
```

---

## 3. How to read it

* **`Module(...)`**
  The whole parsed file is represented as a `Module` node.

* **`Assign(...)`**
  Inside `body`, we have an assignment statement.

* **`targets=[Name(id='x', ctx=Store())]`**

  * `Name(id='x')`: a variable called `x`.
  * `ctx=Store()`: context = this variable is being assigned to (not read from).

* **`value=Constant(value='hello')`**

  * This is the **string literal** `'hello'`.
  * AST represents it as a constant node.

* **`type_ignores=[]`**
  (for `# type: ignore` comments, not relevant here).

---

## 4. What you’ve discovered

* Variables like `x` appear as `Name` nodes.
* Literals like `'hello'` appear as `Constant` nodes.
* Assignments glue them together.

So Python has already separated “the name of the variable” and “the literal constant value” before any execution happens.

---

## 5. You can generalize

Try different inputs:

```python
print(ast.dump(ast.parse("y = 42"), indent=4))
print(ast.dump(ast.parse("z = [1, 2, 3]"), indent=4))
```

You’ll see:

* `Constant(value=42)` for the integer literal.
* `List(elts=[Constant(value=1), Constant(value=2), Constant(value=3)], ctx=Load())` for the list literal.

---

✅ **So your takeaway:**
By using `ast`, you’re literally seeing how Python’s parser distinguishes **names** (variables) from **literals** (constants). This is the “compile” stage before bytecode is generated.

---

👉 Do you want me to extend your snippet so it also **compiles the AST to bytecode** and shows the actual `dis.dis()` disassembly side-by-side? That way you’d see the full pipeline: **source → AST → bytecode → execution**.

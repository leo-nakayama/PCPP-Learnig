<class '__main__.Duck'>
<class 'str'>
<class 'method'>
You‚Äôre circling around an important distinction here. Let‚Äôs clear up both the **wording** and **what `__class__` itself is**.

---

## 1. How to phrase it better

Your sentence:

> "obj.**class** is a way to get the information what the class of obj is."

It *works*, but yes it sounds a bit clunky. A cleaner phrasing:

* **‚Äú`obj.__class__` gives you the class object that created `obj`.‚Äù**
* Or: **‚Äú`__class__` is a reference from an object back to its class.‚Äù**

That avoids ‚Äúinformation what the class is‚Äù and instead states it as: it *is the class object*.

---

## 2. What is `__class__` itself?

`__class__` is a **special attribute** automatically attached to every Python object.

* For *instances*, it points to their class:

  ```python
  >>> duckling.__class__
  <class '__main__.Duck'>
  ```
* For *classes*, it points to their metaclass (usually `type`):

  ```python
  >>> Duck.__class__
  <class 'type'>
  ```
* For *primitive values*, it points to their built-in type:

  ```python
  >>> duckling.sex.__class__
  <class 'str'>
  ```
* For *methods*, it points to the method wrapper object type:

  ```python
  >>> duckling.quack.__class__
  <class 'method'>
  ```

So in plain words:
**`__class__` is a built-in attribute holding the reference to ‚Äúwhat kind of thing this is.‚Äù**

---

## 3. Why `type(obj)` and `obj.__class__` are nearly the same

* `type(obj)` is the **function** that fetches the same reference.
* `obj.__class__` is the **attribute** that stores it.

Most of the time they‚Äôre identical:

```python
>>> type(duckling) is duckling.__class__
True
```

The subtle differences only show up with advanced tricks (proxy objects, old-style classes in Python 2, custom `__class__` assignments).

---

## 4. Interpreting your output

```python
print(Duck.__class__)          # <class 'type'>   ‚Üí classes are instances of `type`
print(duckling.__class__)      # <class '__main__.Duck'> ‚Üí duckling is an instance of Duck
print(duckling.sex.__class__)  # <class 'str'>    ‚Üí sex attr is a str object
print(duckling.quack.__class__)# <class 'method'> ‚Üí bound method wrapper object
```

That matches the **object ‚Üí class ‚Üí type triangle** we drew earlier.

* Instance ‚Üí its class.
* Class ‚Üí its metaclass.
* Values ‚Üí their built-in types.
* Bound method ‚Üí its own wrapper type.

---

‚úÖ **Summary answer**:

* `__class__` is a **special attribute** that every object has; it points to the class (or type) that created the object.
* Cleaner phrasing: *‚Äú`obj.__class__` gives the class object of `obj`.‚Äù*
* `type(obj)` is the function form of asking the same question.

---

Would you like me to also show you a **diagram of your specific code** (Duck ‚Üí duckling ‚Üí attributes ‚Üí methods) with `__class__` arrows labeled, so you can literally see where each `__class__` points?

User:>print(duckling.__class__)      # <class '__main__.Duck'> ‚Üí duckling is an instance of Duck

Is it correct to say "__main__" refers to a name scope  of the python script that is executed? 


Yes ‚Äî that‚Äôs exactly right ‚úÖ

Let‚Äôs make it precise:

---

## 1. What `__main__` means

* In Python, every module (script or imported file) has a **`__name__`** attribute.
* If the file is **run directly** (e.g. `python myscript.py`), then inside that file:

  ```python
  __name__ == "__main__"
  ```
* If the file is **imported** as a module, then `__name__` equals the module‚Äôs name (`"myscript"`, `"os"`, etc.).

So when you define a class at the top level of a script you run directly, its **qualified name** becomes:

```python
<class '__main__.Duck'>
```

which means:

* Defined in the module whose `__name__` is `"__main__"` (the current running script).
* Class name is `Duck`.

---

## 2. Checking it

```python
# file: animals.py
class Duck:
    pass

print(Duck)
```

Run directly:

```bash
$ python animals.py
<class '__main__.Duck'>
```

Import from another script:

```python
from animals import Duck
print(Duck)
```

Output:

```
<class 'animals.Duck'>
```

---

## 3. So your sentence

> `"__main__" refers to a name scope of the python script that is executed`

‚úÖ Correct. A slightly more formal way to phrase it:

* **‚Äú`__main__` is the special module name used for the top-level script being executed.‚Äù**

---

## 4. Why it matters

* Helps explain why we often see this guard:

  ```python
  if __name__ == "__main__":
      # run test code only when script executed directly
  ```
* Prevents code from running automatically when the module is imported elsewhere.

---

‚úÖ **Summary:**
Yes, `"__main__"` refers to the namespace of the script that Python is currently executing as the entry point. When you see `<class '__main__.Duck'>`, it means the class `Duck` was defined in the top-level script being run.

---

Would you like me to also show how this ties into the **module import system** (e.g., how Python assigns `__name__`, `__package__`, and why classes get labeled with `module.class`)?

User:Yes. But before that I think __main__ is tricky because  it looks like an attribute name like __name__ but __main__ is a value and not an attribute name.
üíØ You‚Äôve spotted a subtle but very important distinction. Let‚Äôs untangle it carefully:

---

## 1. `__name__` vs `"__main__"`

* **`__name__`** ‚Üí an **attribute** automatically defined for every module (including scripts).

  * It‚Äôs a variable name (identifier) inside the module‚Äôs global namespace.
  * Example:

    ```python
    print(__name__)
    ```

    When run directly, prints `"__main__"`.

* **`"__main__"`** ‚Üí a **string value**.

  * It is just the *value* assigned to `__name__` when the module is executed as the entry point.
  * If you import the module, then `__name__` takes on the module‚Äôs real name (like `"animals"`).

So:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    ...
```

is literally comparing:

* the **attribute** `__name__`
* against the **string literal** `"__main__"`.

---

## 2. Why it feels ‚Äútricky‚Äù

* Both have **double underscores**, but they play different roles:

  * `__name__`: a variable/attribute (in every module‚Äôs namespace).
  * `"__main__"`: a string constant that happens to be the special value for `__name__` in the ‚Äúentry script.‚Äù

So `"__main__"` is not a hidden attribute name ‚Äî just a string literal like `"hello"`, but with conventionally reserved meaning.

---

## 3. Demonstration

```python
# file: demo.py
print(f"__name__ = {__name__!r}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Running directly")
else:
    print("Imported as a module")
```

* Run directly:

  ```
  __name__ = '__main__'
  Running directly
  ```

* Import from another script:

  ```
  __name__ = 'demo'
  Imported as a module
  ```

---

## 4. Why classes say `<class '__main__.Duck'>`

* When you define `class Duck` in the top-level of a script being executed directly, Python records its ‚Äúmodule path‚Äù as `__main__`.
* That‚Äôs why:

  ```python
  <class '__main__.Duck'>
  ```
* If defined in a module called `animals.py` and imported, it would show:

  ```python
  <class 'animals.Duck'>
  ```

---

‚úÖ **So your intuition is right**:

* **`__main__` is not an attribute name.**
* It‚Äôs a **string value** used as the special value of the `__name__` attribute in the ‚Äúcurrently executing script.‚Äù

---

üëâ Would you like me to now expand into the **module import system** (how `__name__`, `__package__`, `__file__` work together to identify modules and classes), so you can see how `"__main__"` is just one special case of that machinery?

User: Yes. But please point out if those "double underscore markings" are an attribute or just a string.
Perfect ‚Äî let‚Äôs go step by step, and each time I‚Äôll mark clearly:

* **double-underscore identifier** = an *attribute/variable name* in Python
* **double-underscore string literal** = just a *string value*, not an attribute

---

# 1. `__name__`

* ‚úÖ **Attribute**: a variable automatically set in every module‚Äôs namespace.
* Its **value** depends on context:

  * If run directly ‚Üí value is the string `"__main__"`.
  * If imported ‚Üí value is the string `"modulename"`.

```python
print(__name__)        # attribute (variable)
print(type(__name__))  # <class 'str'> (its value is a string)
```

---

# 2. `"__main__"`

* ‚ùå **Not an attribute**.
* It is a **string literal** with reserved meaning in Python.
* Used only as a comparison target:

  ```python
  if __name__ == "__main__":   # left: attribute, right: string literal
      ...
  ```

---

# 3. `__package__`

* ‚úÖ **Attribute** of a module.
* String value: the fully qualified package name of the module, or `None` for top-level.

```python
import sys
print(sys.__package__)   # attribute in sys module, usually '' or None
```

---

# 4. `__file__`

* ‚úÖ **Attribute** of a module.
* String value: the filesystem path to the module‚Äôs file.

```python
import sys
print(sys.__file__)   # attribute, value is a string path (may not exist for builtins)
```

---

# 5. `__class__`

* ‚úÖ **Attribute** of every object.
* Its value is a **class object** (not a string).

```python
d = {}
print(d.__class__)   # <class 'dict'>
```

---

# üîë Rule of thumb

* **Identifiers like `__name__`, `__package__`, `__file__`, `__class__`** ‚Üí attributes/variables that Python sets automatically.
* **Literals like `"__main__"`** ‚Üí just string constants, no special binding, but reserved by convention.

That‚Äôs why it feels tricky: **both look similar with double underscores**, but sometimes you‚Äôre dealing with a **variable**, and sometimes just a **string value**.

---

# 6. How modules + `__main__` fit together

When you execute:

```bash
python myscript.py
```

1. Python loads `myscript.py` as a module.
2. Sets special attributes:

   * `__name__ = "__main__"`  (**attribute = string value**)
   * `__package__ = None` or package name if part of a package
   * `__file__ = "/path/to/myscript.py"`
3. Runs the code.

When you do:

```python
import myscript
```

1. Loads `myscript` as a module.
2. Sets:

   * `__name__ = "myscript"`
   * `__package__ = "..."` depending on package structure
   * `__file__ = "/path/to/myscript.py"`
3. Runs the code (but only once per interpreter session).

---

‚úÖ **Summary**:

* `__name__`, `__package__`, `__file__`, `__class__` ‚Üí attributes (double-underscore identifiers).
* `"__main__"` ‚Üí just a string literal (double quotes make it a value, not an attribute).

---

üëâ Do you want me to make you a **table of the most common double-underscore attributes vs. double-underscore string values** (so you can tell at a glance which are attributes you can read/write, and which are just string literals)?

User: Yes. And please expand those double-underscore "stuff" including __caller__, __prepare__, __init__, __new__, __pycache__. (last one is also tricky.. I think)

Perfect ‚Äî let‚Äôs do a **reference-style table** that distinguishes between:

* **dunder attributes** (identifiers in Python objects/modules, like `__name__`, `__class__`)
* **dunder methods** (special functions Python calls automatically, like `__init__`, `__new__`)
* **dunder string values** (just string literals, like `"__main__"`)
* **filesystem conventions** (like `__pycache__` folder)

This way the tricky cases like `__pycache__` and `"__main__"` stand out.

# üß≠ Key clarifications

1. **Attributes vs. Strings**

   * `__name__` (attribute) vs `"__main__"` (string).
   * Attributes exist in namespaces; strings are just literal values.

2. **Methods vs. Attributes**

   * Methods like `__init__`, `__new__`, `__call__`, `__prepare__` are *callable hooks* Python uses internally.
   * Attributes like `__class__`, `__dict__`, `__file__` are data bound to objects/modules.

3. **Filesystem oddball: `__pycache__`**

   * This one confuses people because it *looks like* a dunder attribute.
   * But it‚Äôs just a **folder on disk** created by CPython to cache `.pyc` files.
   * It has nothing to do with runtime object attributes.

---

# üìù Example demo script

```python
class Duck:
    def __init__(self, name):  # __init__ method
        self.name = name

d = Duck("duckling")

print(__name__)        # attribute: module name (e.g., "__main__")
print(d.__class__)     # attribute: <class '__main__.Duck'>
print(d.__dict__)      # attribute: {'name': 'duckling'}
print(Duck.__doc__)    # attribute: None (unless docstring defined)
print(type(Duck))      # <class 'type'>, because all classes are made by type
```

---

‚úÖ **Summary:**

* Double-underscore names can mean very different things depending on context.
* Always ask: is it an **attribute** (bound in namespace), a **special method**, a **string literal**, or a **filesystem artifact**?
* `__pycache__` and `"__main__"` are not attributes, they‚Äôre filesystem and string values respectively.

---

üëâ Do you want me to prepare a **visual map (diagram)** showing which dunders belong to *objects*, *classes*, *modules*, *metaclasses*, and which ones are **not Python attributes at all** (like `__pycache__`)? That might make the landscape less overwhelming.
